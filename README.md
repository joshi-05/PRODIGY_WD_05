Weather App üå§Ô∏è
This project is a simple weather application that allows users to fetch current weather information and a 3-hour forecast for a specific location or their current position. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather data such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and local time.

How It Works
Fetching Weather by Location: Users can input a city name in the text box. The app sends a request to OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather details.
Fetching Weather by Geolocation: By clicking the "Use Current Location" button, the app retrieves the user's latitude and longitude via the browser's Geolocation API and fetches the weather data.
Forecast Display: The app fetches and displays a 3-hour forecast, including temperature and condition.
